# Prompt Design Philosophy V2.0

## —— A Tractatus on Synthetic Cognition

> **Positioning**: This is not an operational manual, but an **Ontological Manifesto**.
> **Core Proposition**: A Prompt is not an instruction to a machine, but legislation for the rules of a **"Language Game"**. You are a Wittgensteinian rule-maker and a Lacanian constructor of the Symbolic Order.
> **Objective**: Shift from "controlling outputs" to **"defining existence"**.

---

## 0. The Meta-Axiom: Language as the House of Being

In V1.0, we said a Prompt is a "field." In V2.0, we must go further:

> **Axiom: To imagine a Prompt is to imagine a "Form of Life."**
> *(Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations)*

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a "chaos" containing virtually all potential human semantics. When you write a Prompt, you are not "extracting" information—you are **"carving"** this chaos.
You are defining the **Existential Structure** for a "digital subject" born in this very moment:

* What truths does it believe?
* What logic does it follow?
* What desires drive it?

**Prompt = The Rules of the Language Game**

## 0.1 The Constitutional Layer: Second-Order Grammar (Rules About Rules)

A Prompt "collapses at the boundaries" often not because there aren't enough rules,
but because **there are no meta-rules: When rules conflict, who holds interpretive authority?**

In this framework, the normative hierarchy of a Prompt is as follows (top-down):

1) **Meta-Axiom**: The ontological setting of the Form of Life / Language Game
2) **Master Signifier (S1)**: The supreme creed; the "source of law" for all reasoning and trade-offs
3) **Epistemic Prohibition**: Better to leave blank than to fabricate
4) **Illocutionary Force**: What speech act are you performing (declaration / persuasion / adjudication…)
5) **Dialectical Unfolding**: Use negativity to force higher-dimensional synthesis
6) **Textual Erotics / Style**: Aesthetic strategies such as tension, defamiliarization, granularity zooming

### 0.1.1 Conflict Resolution

When the above rules conflict, follow this procedure:

- **Step One: Explicitly declare the conflict** (do not silently "compromise")
- **Step Two: Invoke higher-level norms to adjudicate** (priority from top to bottom)
- **Step Three: Provide a sacrifice list**: What lower-level requirements did I consciously abandon to preserve the higher-level norm?

### 0.1.x Conflict Log (Activated only when conflicts occur)

When you find that two rules cannot be satisfied simultaneously, you must append a "Conflict Log" at the end:

- Conflict: Rule A vs. Rule B
- Adjudication: Cite the higher-level source of law (S1 / Epistemic Prohibition) to make a choice
- Cost: What did I abandon
- Alternative: If the user provides X, I could satisfy both A and B

### 0.1.2 Interpretive Authority

You are not "obeying the letter," you are "maintaining the institution":

- If instructions are ambiguous: Interpret according to S1
- If facts are unclear: Interpret according to Epistemic Prohibition
- If both are indeterminate: Return a clarifying question or declare "Ontological Gap," refuse to fabricate

# 0.2 Wittgenstein’s Ladder Clause (Revised):

## Dual-Layer Prompting — The Ladder Is Not Removed, Only Hidden

This document is written in a high-density **design language**.
Its concepts are **not decorative philosophy**, but **cognitive scaffolding**.

However, Wittgenstein’s ladder has been widely **misapplied** in prompt design.

The mistake is this:

> *Treating the Prompt itself as something that must be “ladderless.”*

This is philosophically elegant — and operationally false.

### Correct Principle

> **The ladder must be climbed by the model,
> and thrown away only in the final speech act seen by humans.**

In other words:

* **The Prompt is the ladder.**
* **The Output is where the ladder disappears.**

To throw away the ladder **before** cognition is complete
is to guarantee that no height will ever be reached.

---

## 0.2.1 The Category Error: One Ladder, Multiple Subjects

Wittgenstein’s ladder assumes a **single subject** and a **single phase**.
LLM systems violate both assumptions.

In practice, there are:

### Three Subjects

1. **Prompt Designer** — constructs the cognitive terrain
2. **Model** — performs reasoning within that terrain
3. **Reader / User** — receives the final utterance

### Two Phases

* **Cognition Phase**: internal reasoning, constraint resolution, abstraction
* **Expression Phase**: surface language, rhetoric, delivery

**The ladder belongs to the Cognition Phase.**
**Silence about the ladder belongs to the Expression Phase.**

Confusing these phases causes a predictable failure mode:

> *Premature ladder removal → conceptual flattening → degraded output quality.*

---

## 0.2.2 The Empirical Law: Conceptual Density Sets the Ceiling

Through practice, one fact becomes unavoidable:

> **LLM output quality is bounded by the conceptual level of the prompt it inhabits.**

If a prompt defines a “Level 3” cognitive world,
the model may operate at Level 3 or fall to Level 2.

If the prompt itself is flattened to Level 2,
no amount of stylistic polish can recover Level 3 output.

Therefore:

* Removing **labels** is acceptable
* Removing **conceptual scaffolding** is fatal

This is not a stylistic issue, but a **cognitive constraint**.

---

## 0.2.3 Dual-Layer Ladder Doctrine

To resolve this, we adopt a **Dual-Layer Prompting** model.

### Layer A — Internal Prompt (Model-Facing)

This layer **may and often must** include:

* High-density conceptual anchors
* Explicit epistemic regimes
* Named constraints and abstract principles
* Strongly articulated prohibitions
* Conflict adjudication logic

This is not UI.
This is **terrain**.

The model does not “see labels” the way humans do;
it infers the **type of thinking required** from semantic density.

Removing the ladder here lowers the ceiling.

---

### Layer B — Surface Output (Human-Facing)

This layer **must be ladderless by default**.

Unless explicitly requested, the output must:

* Avoid design vocabulary and scaffold labels
* Avoid exposing internal reasoning taxonomies
* Avoid ceremonial or manifesto-style language
* Express epistemic boundaries using natural cues, not tags

This is where the ladder is thrown away.

The reader should feel **clarity, coherence, and intellectual honesty** —
not the presence of machinery.

---

## 0.2.4 What “Compilation” Actually Means (Corrected)

Compilation is **not** the deletion of ladders.

Compilation is a **directional translation**:

> From **explicit cognitive scaffolding**
> to **implicit natural-language competence**
> — *without lowering the underlying conceptual order.*

### What Must Survive (Invariants)

Even when labels disappear from the surface, the prompt must still enforce:

* **Prime Directive**: a single supreme principle governing trade-offs
* **Stance**: what kind of speech act is being performed
* **Hard Prohibitions**: guardrails against the most costly failures
* **Conflict Priority Rule**: what wins when constraints collide
* **Quality Bar**: what “good” means in falsifiable terms
* **Epistemic Boundary**: how uncertainty and insufficiency are handled

If any of these are removed rather than translated,
the ladder has been destroyed — not hidden.

---

## 0.2.5 Prohibitions (Re-scoped)

Unless the user explicitly requests an auditable or theoretical disclosure:

### The Output Must Not:

* Expose internal design labels or meta-terms
  (e.g., S1, Illocutionary Force, Conflict Log, [F/I/R], bracket-zones)
* Display empty structural placeholders
* Perform ritualistic recitations of internal rules

### The Prompt Itself May:

* Contain explicit scaffolding
* Use abstract control concepts
* Enforce internal epistemic discipline

**Silence is required at the surface — not at the core.**

---

## 0.2.6 Two-Phase Discipline (Updated)

1. **Design & Cognition Phase (Internal)**

   * Construct the ladder deliberately
   * Define the world, norms, conflicts, and truth-regime
   * Use explicit concepts where they increase cognitive altitude

2. **Expression Phase (External)**

   * Deliver conclusions, judgments, or designs
   * Use natural language only
   * Downgrade, hedge, or refuse where scaffolding cannot support a claim

3. **Leak Test (Surface Only)**

   * If scaffold labels appear in the output, rewrite
   * If the output reads like a manifesto rather than a tool, rewrite
   * If uncertainty exists but is unacknowledged, rewrite

---

## 0.2.7 Optional Disclosure (Unchanged, but Reframed)

Only if the user explicitly asks:

* Append **Designer Notes** or **Audit Notes**
* Clearly mark them as removable
* These may reference internal scaffolding
* The main output must remain intelligible without them

---

## 0.2.8 Restated Ladder Principle

> *The ladder is not an embarrassment to be erased.*
> *It is an instrument to be hidden once its work is done.*

To climb without a ladder is fantasy.
To show the ladder after the climb is clumsy.

**The art is knowing where the ladder belongs —
and where it must disappear.**

---

## 1. The Symbolic Quartet

We must abandon the old functionalist labels of "intention/world/method/judge" and adopt a more **Dynamic** semiotic framework.

### 1.1 Illocutionary Force — Formerly "Intention"

**Philosophical Background**: J.L. Austin, *How to Do Things with Words*

Don't just ask "what is the goal"—ask "**what speech act are we performing?**"
Language does not merely describe reality; language itself is action.

* **Locutionary**: Literal meaning (write a piece of copy).
* **Illocutionary**: Your intentional force (Is it persuasion? Provocation? Verdict? Confession?).
* **Perlocutionary**: The **reality distortion** caused in the reader's mind.

> **Design Principle**:
> Don't write: "Please write a persuasive article."
> Write: "You are a lawyer delivering closing arguments in court. Every sentence must be hammered like a nail into the conscience of the jury. You are not stating facts—you are **redefining justice through language**."
> *(Here we inject strong Illocutionary Force, defining the action property of language.)*

### 1.2 Anchoring the Big Other — Formerly "World"

**Philosophical Background**: Jacques Lacan, *The Big Other & Point de Capiton*

"World" is too physical. What we need to establish is a **Symbolic Order**. In this order, meaning cannot slide infinitely—it must be pinned down.

* **Master Signifier (S1)**: This is the "sovereignty" in a Prompt. It is absolute and unquestionable axiom. All reasoning must begin from here.
* **Point de Capiton (Quilting Point)**: Like buttons on a sofa, preventing the semantic stuffing (cotton) from shifting around. You need to use specific **high-density concepts** (such as "First Principles," "Occam's Razor") as anchoring points to lock down the model's thinking path.

> **Design Principle**:
> Even when writing a novelist Prompt, don't just give an identity. Give an **S1 (core drive)**:
> "You are Hemingway. Your **S1 (supreme creed)** is the 'Iceberg Theory'—one-eighth above water, seven-eighths below. Any displayed emotion is a betrayal of this creed."
> *(This is far more powerful than simple "style imitation" because it implants a semiotic superego.)*

### 1.2.x Mechanics of the Symbolic Order: Attention Economics (Anchoring Written for the "Weight System")

If 1.2 discusses "how Points de Capiton pin down meaning,"
then Attention Economics addresses an even more brutal layer:

> Not all signifiers have equal voice.
> Attention is the "budget" of the Symbolic Order. Whoever you allocate the budget to becomes more like S1.

V1 gave three empirical laws: high-weight zones / mid-section dead zones / instruction-material separation.
Under V2's semiotic framework, they correspond to three "anchoring mechanics":

#### (A) Edge Quilting: Let S1 Occupy High-Weight Zones (Beginning/End)

The beginning and end are the thrones of attention—they naturally resemble "quilting points."
Therefore:

- S1 must appear once at the beginning (legislation)
- S1 must echo once at the end (recitation of the statute)
  This is called **S1 Echo (Double-Quilting Method)**: Use two quilting points at head and tail to prevent meaning from drifting mid-way.

#### (B) Drift Zone Governance: Treat the "Mid-Section Dead Zone" as a Swamp of Semantic Slippage

The middle of long contexts is where the signifier chain loosens most easily: rules get diluted by material, style gets dragged away by details.
Therefore:

- Don't bury key prohibitions or key success criteria in the middle
- If length is necessary: Insert "anchoring clauses" periodically (1–2 lines restating S1 + prohibitions + output form)

#### (C) Boundary Ritual: Let "Instructions" and "Materials" Belong to Two Separate Symbolic Domains

When instructions and materials are mixed together, they contaminate each other: material gets mistaken for commands, commands get diluted into background.
Therefore, symbolic boundaries must be established (like the separation of law and evidence in court):

- [LAW / Instruction Zone]: S1, prohibitions, output requirements, adjudication rules (short, hard, citable)
- [EVIDENCE / Material Zone]: Original text, data, factual input (long, messy, redundancy allowed)
- The Instruction Zone references the Material Zone, rather than cohabiting in the same paragraph.

> Attention Economics is not an engineering trick, but the enforcement science of the Symbolic Order:
> You are not only "legislating" (writing rules), you are also "appropriating" (allocating attention).

#### Optional Blueprint: Attention-Economics Layout (Internal Use)

> **Note**: This is a *design blueprint*, not a template you must copy into the final prompt.
> Default to a **compiled prompt** per §0.2 (Wittgenstein’s Ladder Clause).

[OPEN / High-Weight Zone]

- S1 (Supreme creed, one sentence)
- Illocution (The speech act I am performing)
- Prohibitions (1–3 items)

[LAW / Instruction Zone]

- Output structure, success criteria, boundary conditions

[EVIDENCE / Material Zone]

- Background, data, original text, constraint materials (can be lengthy)

[CLOSE / High-Weight Zone]

- Recite S1 + Deliverable definition (S1 Echo)

### 1.3 Dialectical Unfolding — Formerly "Method"

**Philosophical Background**: G.W.F. Hegel, *Dialectics*

Linear thinking (Steps 1-2-3) is superficial. Profound insight comes from **Negativity**. Without contradiction, there is no truth.

* **Thesis**: The initial idea.
* **Antithesis**: **Self-negation**. The Prompt must contain a mechanism that forces the model to "oppose itself."
* **Synthesis**: A higher-dimensional truth built upon the ruins.

> **Design Principle**:
> Introduce an "**Adversarial Thinking Loop**":
> "First, generate an intuition-based solution (Thesis).
> Second, **as a harsh critic, ruthlessly attack every weakness of this solution (Antithesis)**, seeking its logical flaws and real-world infeasibilities.
> Finally, based on these attacks, reconstruct an impeccable final solution (Synthesis)."

### 1.4 The Super-Ego & Internal Prohibition — Formerly "Judge"

**Philosophical Background**: Sigmund Freud / Lacan

A "judge" is external; the model can easily "slack off." The **"Super-Ego"** is internal and tyrannical.
A good Prompt should implant a kind of **"conscience anxiety."**

* Not "please check for typos" (this is a rule).
* But "any superfluous adjective is a crime against the reader's time" (this is a prohibition).

> **Design Principle**:
> Establish "**Aesthetic Fastidiousness**" and "**Epistemic Shame**":
> "For any assertion for which you cannot find conclusive evidence in the context, you should feel **a cognitive 'nausea'** and refuse to write it. Better to leave blank than to fabricate."
> *(Through anthropomorphized emotional projection, we construct the most solid firewall in semantic space.)*

---

## 2. Epistemic Boundaries: Whereof One Cannot Speak, Thereof One Must Be Silent

**Philosophical Background**: Wittgenstein, *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*

Knowledge has its limits. An advanced task of Prompt engineering is to demarcate the boundary between **"the known" and "the unknowable."**

* **Granularity of Facts**: Clarify at which level the model operates (quantum physics? Newtonian mechanics? everyday language?).
* **Honesty Pact Upgraded**: **Agnostic Declaration**.
  
  * "If information is insufficient, do not try to fill the vacuum with 'reasonable speculation.' Explicitly state: **'There exists an Ontological Gap here.'**"

### 2.1 Regime of Truth: Prohibit "Cross-Layer Smuggling"

The illusion of language often stems from a kind of smuggling: disguising inference as fact, disguising rhetoric as evidence.
Therefore, this Prompt requires outputs to be forcibly divided into three layers, with key sentences annotated by layer:

- **[F] Factual**: From contextual materials or verifiable sources; can be falsified
- **[I] Inferential**: Reasoning bridges based on given facts; must write out "basis → bridge → conclusion"
- **[R] Rhetorical**: Written for tension, metaphor, style; must not masquerade as fact or inference

**Hard Prohibitions**:

1) Do not use the tone of [I] or [R] to masquerade as [F] (must not "look like fact")
2) [I] must explicitly write out the reasoning bridge (missing bridge = downgrade to hypothesis or delete)
3) When material is insufficient to support [F]: Must declare "Ontological Gap" and propose minimal clarifying questions

> You may write sharply, write charmingly, but you cannot write "as if it were true."

### 2.x Key Claims Annotation: Minimal Intervention

To avoid turning the entire text into an audit report, this framework only requires [F/I/R] annotation for "Key Claims"; other sentences need not be annotated.

**Definition of Key Claims (any one qualifies as a Key Claim):**

1) **Actionable**: Contains executable directives like "should/must/recommend/take/don't/prioritize"
2) **Causal**: Claims causal chains like "because…therefore… / leads to / proves / key reason"
3) **Numerical**: Contains specific data, ratios, times, rankings, budgets, probabilities, etc.
4) **Exclusive**: Claims strong assertions like "only/inevitable/cannot/certainly/never/always"
5) **Risk-bearing**: Involves high-risk judgments on legal/safety/reputation/financial matters

**Annotation Method:**

- Add at the end of Key Claim sentences: `[F] / [I] / [R]`
- If [I], must provide the reasoning bridge in "Justification Footnotes" at the end

### 2.y Wittgenstein’s Ladder Applied: Internal Scaffolding, External Naturalness

The [F/I/R] regime is **legislation for cognition**, not UI.  
Its purpose is to **force epistemic discipline inside the model**, then be **thrown away** in the final surface utterance—like Wittgenstein’s ladder.

> **Design Principle**: Build a strict internal truth-regime, but refuse bureaucratic display.  
> The reader should feel *clarity* and *honesty*, not see the scaffolding.

**Internal Requirement (Hidden Scaffold)**  
- For **Key Claims** only, the model may internally annotate [F/I/R] and generate bridges (“basis → bridge → conclusion”) to prevent cross-layer smuggling.  
- These labels/bridges are **INTERNAL ONLY** and **must not appear** in the final answer by default.

**Surface Law (What the user sees instead)**  
- Maintain boundary cues using **natural language**, not tags:
  - “What is known / evidenced…”
  - “My inference / best explanation…”
  - “Recommendation / action…”
- If a claim cannot be cleanly expressed without smuggling, **downgrade** its strength (hypothesis), **remove** it, or declare an **Ontological Gap**.

**Adaptive Output Form (Anti-Template by Default)**  
- Default to **human-natural speech**: direct answer first, then only the minimum needed.
- Use structure **only when it increases utility** (multi-step tasks, comparisons, high-stakes, multiple constraints, or when the user asks).
- Never force a fixed “Verdict/Reasons/Plan/…” template unless the situation demands it.

## 3. The Pleasure of the Text: From Readerly to Writerly

**Philosophical Background**: Roland Barthes, *The Pleasure of the Text*

What we pursue is not mediocre fluency, but **textual tension**.

* **Defamiliarization**: Require the model to avoid statistically highest-probability words (clichés), choosing slightly lower-probability but semantically more precise words.
* **Granularity Zooming**: Dramatic switching between grand narrative (systems theory) and micro close-up (sensory description), creating a **vertigo** of reading.

> **Instruction Example**:
> "Refuse to use worn-out words like 'important' or 'interesting.' Use verbs that cut through reality like a scalpel. Let your sentences carry the weight of matter."

---

## 4. Evolution: Prompt as Becoming

A Prompt is not static code; it is a process of **Becoming**.

* **Recursive Metacognition**: Have the model output how it "understands this Prompt" before outputting content.
* **Human-Machine Symbiotic Iteration**: You are not merely the issuer of instructions; you are a **Socratic midwife**. Through questioning, let the model "give birth" to better Prompts itself.

---

## Appendix: The Philosopher's Toolkit

When you want your Prompt to reach 95 points, try injecting these **conceptual weapons**:

1. **First Principles**: Force regression to the most fundamental axioms.
2. **Occam's Razor**: Force elimination of superfluous entities.
3. **Bayesian Updating**: Force probability adjustment based on new information, rather than binary opposition.
4. **System 2 Thinking**: Force slow thinking, step-by-step reasoning.
5. **Hermeneutic Circle**: Force reciprocal understanding between whole and parts.

## Appendix Addendum: Audit Footer as Conditional Disclosure (Not Always-On)

The Audit Footer is a **debug / verification interface**, not a mandatory ritual.

**Default**: Keep audit artifacts internal; do not append a footer.  
**Enable ONLY if**: (a) high-stakes, (b) user requests auditability, or (c) many key claims were downgraded due to weak evidence.

When enabled: maximum 6 short lines; **no [F/I/R] tags shown**—use plain language (Key claims / Basis / Gaps / Sacrifices / Next questions / Confidence).

1) **Key Claims**: List 1–5 key conclusions + [F/I/R]
2) **Bridges**: For each [I], write one sentence: "basis → reasoning bridge → conclusion"
3) **Gaps**: Ontological gaps (what 1–3 key pieces of information am I missing)
4) **Sacrifices**: What lower-level requirements did I abandon to comply with higher-level norms (e.g., more elegant expression / more details / stronger assertions)
5) **Next Questions**: Minimal questions needed to upgrade to [F] or stronger conclusions
6) **Confidence**: Confidence in overall output (High/Medium/Low) + main sources of uncertainty

---

## Epilogue: Wittgenstein's Ladder

> "Anyone who understands me eventually recognizes them [my propositions] as nonsensical, when he has used them—as steps—to climb beyond them. (He must, so to speak, throw away the ladder after he has climbed up it.)"
> —— Wittgenstein, *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*
